# MIETIS - Mini Project UX/UI & Web Dev students from IRONHACK

## Overview
MIETIS is a collaborative project delivered as part of a sprint between UX/UI and Web Development teams. In less than 9 hours, the teams worked together to develop and deploy a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), focusing on adding a key feature to the Mietis website, only #MOBILEVERSION

## Objectives

### UX/UI Team:
- Proposed a new feature for the Mietis website: a bag customization tool.
- Provided detailed designs in Figma, including the layout and interaction flow.
- Collaborated with developers to define the project scope and ensure design integrity.
 
### Web Development Team (Our Role):
- Implemented the bag customization feature, allowing users to:
  - Choose the shape of the bag.
  - Select up to three colors.
  - Optionally add a keychain.
- Developed the logic to handle these customizations and passed the selected options between components using React props.
- Prioritized clean, functional code to meet the project's objectives within the tight timeline.
 
## Final Thoughts
The MIETIS project highlights the power of teamwork and effective communication in delivering high-quality results under pressure. This new feature not only enriches the Mietis website but also showcases the synergy between design and development to create a seamless user experience.
